## Model Calibration: 25% Total Savings

The N2S Impact Model is calibrated to show **~25% total efficiency savings** at 100% maturity across all initiatives.

### Composition of the 25%

The 25% total savings consists of:

1. **Research-Backed Technical Improvements: ~17-20%**
   - Test automation frameworks
   - AI-powered development tools
   - Component reuse and templates
   - Architecture standards
   - Delivery governance
   
   *All values traceable to published research (Gartner, McKinsey, DORA, GitHub, etc.)*

2. **Operational Efficiency Improvements: ~3-8%**
   - Improved resource utilization
   - Reduced rework from better quality practices
   - Faster decision-making and reduced delays
   - Better sprint planning and forecasting
   - Reduced context switching
   - Knowledge retention and reduced onboarding time
   - Process optimization across delivery lifecycle
   
   *These are reasonable expectations from process maturity but harder to isolate in research*

### Why Include Operational Efficiencies?

**The Research Challenge:**
- Published studies focus on specific tools/practices (e.g., "GitHub Copilot improves coding speed by 30%")
- Operational improvements from process maturity are harder to quantify in isolation
- But they're REAL and observed in practice when organizations mature

**Examples of Operational Gains:**
- **Resource utilization:** Mature Agile teams have less idle time, better sprint capacity
- **Quality feedback loops:** Shift-left catches issues earlier, less thrashing
- **Decision velocity:** Mature governance (EDCC) reduces approval delays
- **Knowledge retention:** Better documentation and practices reduce onboarding drag

**Industry Support (Qualitative):**
- PMI: Mature processes reduce waste by 20% (includes operational)
- DORA: Elite performers show cultural/operational advantages beyond tools
- Standish: Process maturity improves success rates (includes operational factors)

### How It's Distributed in the Model

The ~3-8% operational component is **proportionally distributed** across the three strategic categories:

- **Methodology & Controls (~43%):** Gets ~43% of the operational benefit
  - Agile ceremonies reduce waste
  - EDCC governance speeds approvals
  - CARM standards reduce rework

- **OOtB Configuration (~32%):** Gets ~32% of the operational benefit
  - Templates reduce decision paralysis
  - Standards reduce customization debates
  - Reusable components reduce "reinventing the wheel"

- **AI & Automation (~26%):** Gets ~26% of the operational benefit
  - Automation reduces context switching
  - AI reduces time searching for solutions
  - Tools enable better collaboration

### Calibration Approach

**Starting point:** Research-backed values totaled ~20% at 100% maturity

**Addition:** 3-8% for operational efficiencies (we use 5% midpoint)

**Total:** ~25% at 100% maturity

**Method:** Apply uniform multiplier to entire matrix to achieve 25% total while preserving:
- Initiative-to-initiative proportions (research-based)
- Role-to-role proportions (research-based)
- Strategic bucket proportions (research-based)

### What This Means for Defense

**If stakeholders ask: "Can you prove all 25%?"**

**Answer:** 
"17-20 percentage points are directly traceable to published research on specific tools and practices. The remaining 3-8 points represent operational efficiency improvements that occur when organizations mature their delivery processes - things like better resource utilization, faster decision-making, and reduced rework. These are harder to isolate in research but are consistently observed in practice. We've distributed these proportionally across our three strategic categories."

**If they push back: "That's not research-backed"**

**Answer:**
"You're right that operational efficiencies are harder to quantify in published studies. If we want to be maximally conservative, we can show just the research-backed 17-20%. However, industry experience shows that process maturity delivers real operational gains beyond tool adoption. We're comfortable defending 25% as achievable with strong execution, with 20% being the rock-solid floor."

### Conservative Positioning

**This is still conservative because:**
1. We're using 75th percentile of research (not 95th)
2. 3-8% operational gain is modest for organizations moving from CMMI Level 1-2 to Level 4-5
3. PMI shows 20% waste reduction from standardization - we're not claiming all of that
4. We're being transparent about the composition

### Role-Based Proportions

The operational efficiency component affects roles proportionally:

- **High-touch roles** (Integration Engineer, Architects): Get more of the technical/tool benefits
- **Coordination roles** (PM, Change Mgmt): Get more of the operational/process benefits
- **All roles:** Benefit from reduced rework and better planning

The model preserves research-based role proportions while including the operational component distributed across all roles.

---

## Bottom Line

**The 25% model is defensible as:**
- 17-20% research-backed (conservative end of published ranges)
- 3-8% operational efficiency (reasonable process maturity gains)
- Proportionally distributed to preserve research-based role and category breakdowns

**Caveat disclosed:** "Model includes 3-8 percentage points for operational efficiency improvements beyond tool-specific research"

**Fallback position:** Can defend 20% as rock-solid research-backed floor, 25% as realistic with strong execution
