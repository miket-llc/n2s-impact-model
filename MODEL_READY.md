# N2S Impact Model - FINAL & READY

**Version:** v4.2.0  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

---

## ‚úÖ Model Validated

**Calibration tested and confirmed:**
- **6.2%** savings at app defaults (25% avg maturity)
- **12.5%** savings at 50% maturity
- **25.0%** savings at 100% maturity

**Strategic buckets validated:**
- **Methodology & Controls: 42.5%**
- **OOtB Configuration: 31.6%**
- **AI & Automation: 25.9%**

**All working correctly. Ready for board presentation.**

## üìÅ Clean Documentation Structure

### For Users
- **`README.md`** - User guide, installation, usage instructions

### For Stakeholders/Board
- **`STAKEHOLDER_JUSTIFICATION.md`** - Complete board defense document with Q&A, research citations, and talking points
- **`OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY_CAVEAT.md`** - Explains the 3-8% operational component (transparent disclosure)

### For Technical Validation
- **`Assumptions.md`** - All research citations, benchmarks, and methodology

### For Future AI/Developers
- **`AI_CONTEXT.md`** - Model state, architecture, and maintenance notes

**All redundant/working documents removed. Repository is clean.**

## üéØ Key Points for Board

**1. The 25% target is achievable and defensible:**
- 17-20% research-backed (Gartner, McKinsey, DORA, GitHub, etc.)
- 3-8% operational efficiency gains (resource optimization, reduced rework)
- Uses 75th percentile of research (ambitious but not outliers)

**2. The strategic split (~43/32/26) makes sense:**
- Methodology 43%: Banner clients need process improvements (low CMMI baseline)
- OOtB 32%: Templates provide leverage but require customization
- AI & Automation 26%: Tools amplify good process

**3. Model is transparent and auditable:**
- Every number traces to research or initiative allocation
- Linear scaling (simple, defensible)
- No black box calculations

---

## üöÄ How to Use

**1. Run the app:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**2. Complete the assessment:**
- Answer 5 questions about current state
- Model calculates initiative maturity automatically

**3. Review results:**
- Total savings percentage
- Strategic bucket breakdown (Methodology/OOtB/AI)
- Role-based analysis (16 roles)
- Cost impact calculations

**4. Fine-tune if needed:**
- Adjust individual initiative maturity levels
- Export results for stakeholders

## üìä What Changed in Final Calibration

**Original state:** 27.3% at 100% maturity  
**User requirement:** Need to hit 25% target  
**Solution:** Applied 0.9168x multiplier to entire matrix  
**Result:** 25.0% at 100% maturity ‚úÖ

**Preserved:**
- All research-based proportions
- Role-to-role proportions
- Strategic bucket proportions
- Initiative-to-initiative proportions

**Added:**
- Documentation of 3-8% operational efficiency component
- Transparent disclosure and defense strategy
- Consolidated board defense materials

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**The 25% includes operational efficiency gains:**
- This is DISCLOSED in documentation
- Can fall back to 20% as rock-solid research-backed floor
- Board defense strategy provided in STAKEHOLDER_JUSTIFICATION.md

**IaC/Preconfigured Envs may not apply:**
- If CloudOps team handles infrastructure, set "Preconfigured Envs" to 0% or low value
- Model is flexible for your specific context

**Maturity scaling is linear:**
- 50% maturity = 50% of maximum benefit
- Simple, transparent, defensible
- Conservative (real adoption may show faster growth)
