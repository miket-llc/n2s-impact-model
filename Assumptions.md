# N2S Efficiency Model: Assumptions & Industry Benchmarks

**UPDATED:** October 17, 2025 - Model rebuilt with explicit baseline definition and research-backed calculations

This document outlines the research-based assumptions, industry benchmarks, and validation criteria used in the Navigate-to-SaaS (N2S) efficiency modeling application.

## ðŸ”„ NEW: Explicit Baseline Definition

The model now explicitly defines the "baseline" as a **typical Banner client starting point**:

- **Manual regression testing:** 100% manual (no automated testing frameworks)
- **Basic CI/CD:** Automated builds, manual deployments  
- **Custom integrations:** Minimal code reuse (<10%)
- **Manual environment setup:** Some scripting, mostly manual (2-4 days per environment)
- **Traditional PM:** Waterfall-adjacent project management
- **Bug detection:** Primarily in testing phases (not shift-left)
- **Standard defect rates:** 2-5 defects per 1000 LOC
- **No comprehensive reuse:** Each project builds most components from scratch

This baseline represents approximately **CMMI Level 1-2** maturity.

## ðŸ†• NEW: How Savings Are Calculated

The model uses a straightforward, research-grounded methodology:

1. **Each initiative has documented max savings** per phase (from research studies)
   - Example: "Automated Testing" â†’ 50% max reduction in Test phase (Perfecto/Testlio: 30-50%)
   
2. **Maturity scales linearly** (conservative approach)
   - 0% maturity â†’ 0% of max benefit (baseline)
   - 50% maturity â†’ 50% of max benefit
   - 100% maturity â†’ 100% of max benefit

3. **Benefits are additive** across initiatives
   - Total savings per phase = SUM(initiative savings for that phase)
   
4. **Actual savings % is OUTPUT, not input**
   - The model CALCULATES savings based on your maturity levels
   - Target % slider is now just a REFERENCE for planning

**Example Calculation:**
- Baseline: 17,054 hours, Test phase = 3,411 hours (20%)
- Initiative: Automated Testing at 50% maturity
- Max benefit: 50% reduction in Test phase
- Actual benefit: 50% Ã— 50% = 25% reduction
- Hours saved: 3,411 Ã— 25% = 853 hours in Test phase

## Industry Research Sources - MATRIX CALIBRATION BASIS

**Model Recalibrated:** October 17, 2025 to 75th percentile of research ranges

- New calibration: 50% maturity â†’ ~12% savings (~1.4x increase)
- Scaling factor: Applied consistently across all initiatives
- **Justification:** Original was 25th percentile (very conservative), new is 75th percentile (ambitious)

## Model Assumptions

### ðŸ”„ NEW: How Target % Works

**IMPORTANT CHANGE:** The target % slider is now a **REFERENCE ONLY**, not a forcing function.

- **OLD approach (BROKEN):** Model forced results to match target using arbitrary scaling
- **NEW approach (CORRECT):** Model calculates actual savings from initiative maturity
  
**What happens now:**
1. You set initiative maturity levels (0-100% for each initiative)
2. Model calculates savings using research-backed percentages
3. Model shows "Actual Modeled Savings %" as result
4. If actual < target, UI shows the gap and suggests increasing maturity levels

**Example scenarios based on maturity:**
- **Conservative (Most at 25%):** Expect 8-12% total savings
- **Moderate (Most at 50%):** Expect 15-20% total savings  
- **Aggressive (Most at 75-100%):** Expect 25-35% total savings
- **Focused (100% on 2-3 initiatives):** Expect 12-18% total savings

### Financial Model Assumptions

#### Cost Categories
- **Direct Cost Savings**: Development phases (Discover through Deploy)
  - Immediate reduction in project hours and associated labor costs
  - Measurable during project execution
  
- **Cost Avoidance**: Post Go-Live phase and ongoing support
  - Prevention of defects and issues that would require future fixes
  - Reduced support and maintenance overhead
  - Deferred costs rather than immediate savings

#### Labor Rate Model
- **Blended Rate**: Single hourly rate across all roles (default $100/hour)
- **Assumption**: Simplified model assumes consistent labor costs across phases
- **Future Enhancement**: Role-based costing for more precision

#### Risk Weights
- **Purpose**: Account for implementation difficulty and uncertainty by phase
- **Default Progression**: 1-7 multiplier (Discover=1, Post Go-Live=7)
- **Rationale**: Later phases have higher complexity and change risk
- **Application**: Multiplied against modeled hours for risk assessment

### Validation Boundaries

#### Maximum Total Cost Reduction
- **NEW Limit**: 50% total cost reduction for aggressive N2S implementations
- **Basis**: With full maturity across all initiatives (100%), research suggests 35-45% is achievable
- **Implementation**: Model naturally caps at research-backed maximums per phase

#### Phase-Specific Natural Caps (Built into Research Data)
- **Testing Phase**: 50% max savings (Perfecto/Testlio: 30-50% range)
- **Build Phase**: 35% max savings (Code reuse + AI/Automation combined)
- **Deploy Phase**: 40% max savings (IaC + automation)
- **Post Go-Live**: 30% max savings (Defect prevention)
- **Early Phases**: 20-30% max savings (Limited automation, more methodology)

#### Maturity Scaling (Linear & Conservative)
- **Linear Application**: savings = max_savings Ã— (maturity/100)
- **Conservative Approach**: No exponential scaling, no compounding effects
- **Reality Check**: Actual adoption may show S-curves; model uses straight lines for safety

## Data Quality Standards

### Matrix Input Requirements
- **Hour Deltas**: Must be realistic relative to phase baseline hours
- **Sign Convention**: Negative values = hour savings, Positive values = additional effort
- **Granularity**: Initiative-level detail for meaningful maturity assessment
- **Validation**: Cross-check against published case study ranges

### Calculation Precision
- **Rounding**: Results displayed with appropriate precision for business decisions
- **Currency**: Whole dollar amounts for cost calculations
- **Percentages**: One decimal place for variance calculations
- **Hours**: Whole hour amounts for effort estimates

## Known Limitations

### Model Simplifications
1. **Linear Scaling**: Benefits may not scale linearly with maturity in practice
2. **Independence**: Assumes initiatives are independent (no interaction effects)
3. **Timing**: Does not model implementation sequencing or learning curves
4. **Context**: Generic model may not reflect organization-specific factors

### Data Dependencies
1. **Matrix Quality**: Results highly dependent on accurate initiative hour deltas
2. **Baseline Accuracy**: Phase allocation percentages must reflect actual project structure
3. **Rate Assumptions**: Single blended rate may not capture role-specific variations

### Industry Benchmark Limitations
1. **Temporal**: Research studies reflect specific time periods and market conditions
2. **Contextual**: Published case studies may not reflect Ellucian's specific environment
3. **Selection Bias**: Published results may overrepresent successful implementations

## Validation Methodology

### Internal Consistency Checks
- Phase allocation percentages sum to 100%
- No negative hours in final calculations
- Savings remain within credible industry bounds
- Risk-weighted calculations preserve relative relationships

### External Benchmark Alignment
- Total improvement percentages align with published research ranges
- Phase-specific improvements consistent with automation potential
- Financial benefits proportional to industry case study results

### Sensitivity Analysis Recommendations
1. **Maturity Variation**: Test model with different maturity level combinations
2. **Scenario Comparison**: Validate that scenarios show progressive improvement
3. **Phase Weight Sensitivity**: Assess impact of different baseline allocations
4. **Rate Sensitivity**: Evaluate model behavior with different labor rates

## Continuous Improvement

### Model Updates
- **Quarterly Review**: Update industry benchmarks with latest research
- **Calibration**: Compare model predictions with actual implementation results
- **Enhancement**: Incorporate feedback from model users and stakeholders

### Research Integration
- **New Studies**: Incorporate emerging research on shift-left practices
- **Case Studies**: Update assumptions based on additional implementation data
- **Technology Evolution**: Adjust for improvements in automation tools and practices
