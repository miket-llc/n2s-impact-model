# Next Steps - Model Completion

**Status:** Model functional but needs final calibration validation  
**Blocking Issue:** Starting at 6.5% instead of expected 10% for Level 2

---

## Immediate (Before Git Commit)

### 1. **Validate Current Calibration**
- [ ] Test app at http://localhost:8501
- [ ] Check: What % does it show at Level 2 defaults?
- [ ] Check: Does changing assessment questions update savings?
- [ ] Check: Does fine-tune expander work?

### 2. **If Showing 6.5% (Too Low)**

**Action:** Multiply matrix by 1.5x

```python
# In model.py, get_calibrated_matrix()
# Multiply ALL values by 1.5
```

**Expected result:**
- Level 2: 6.5% × 1.5 = ~9.75% ✅
- 50% maturity: ~13% × 1.5 = ~19.5% (too high)

**Wait, that's wrong math...**

**Better approach:** Calculate exact multiplier needed
```python
current_at_level2 = 6.5%
target_at_level2 = 10%
multiplier = 10.0 / 6.5 = 1.54x
```

Apply 1.54x to matrix → Should hit 10% at Level 2

### 3. **If Showing ~10% (Correct)**

- [ ] Test reactivity (change dropdowns, see update)
- [ ] Validate 100% maturity → ~26-28%
- [ ] Check role breakdown looks realistic
- [ ] Check bucket breakdown sums correctly

### 4. **When Everything Works**

- [ ] Update config.py APP_VERSION to "v4.0.0 - Research-Calibrated"
- [ ] Final test of all scenarios
- [ ] Ready for git commit

---

## Git Commit (When Ready)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "MAJOR: Rebuild model with research-grounded calibration

- Fixed target % forcing logic (was broken, now removed)
- Restored and recalibrated matrix to 75th percentile of research
- Added Agile+DevOps initiative (8th initiative)
- Linked assessment questions to initiative maturity
- Removed orphaned benchmark sliders
- Cleaned up session notes and temp files

Calibration: Level 2 → ~10%, 50% → ~13%, 100% → ~26-28%
Research: Gartner, McKinsey, DORA, Forrester, GitHub, Puppet
Validation: Role-based and strategic bucket breakdowns preserved

Target 25% achievable at 90-95% maturity across key initiatives"

git push origin main
```

**DO NOT COMMIT if model isn't working correctly**

---

## Short-Term (Next Session)

### 1. **Pilot Validation**
- Run model against actual project
- Compare predictions to actuals
- Calibrate based on real data

### 2. **Enhanced Reporting**
- Add "Path to 25%" visualization
- Show which initiatives to prioritize
- Sensitivity analysis (what if scenarios)

### 3. **User Training**
- Document how to use assessment correctly
- Create examples/case studies
- Video walkthrough

---

## Medium-Term Enhancements

### 1. **Confidence Intervals**
- Add 25th-75th percentile ranges to all predictions
- Show optimistic/pessimistic scenarios
- Based on research variance

### 2. **Scenario Comparison**
- Save multiple scenarios
- Compare side-by-side
- Track changes over time

### 3. **Implementation Planning**
- Add timeline/sequencing
- Show investment requirements
- ROI calculation including implementation costs

### 4. **Actual vs Predicted Tracking**
- Build dashboard for tracking
- Compare model to reality
- Continuous calibration

---

## Long-Term Vision

### 1. **Machine Learning Calibration**
- Feed actual results back to model
- Auto-calibrate based on YOUR organization
- Improve predictions over time

### 2. **Expanded Scope**
- Revenue impact (time-to-market value)
- Quality metrics (defect rates, customer satisfaction)
- Risk modeling (Monte Carlo simulation)

### 3. **Integration**
- Pull data from Jira/GitHub/etc
- Auto-assess current maturity
- Real-time dashboards

## Known Limitations

**The model does NOT account for:**
- Implementation costs (training, tools, change management)
- Organizational resistance and culture
- Learning curves and adoption timelines
- Context-specific factors unique to your organization
- Revenue benefits from faster delivery

**Use the model for:**
- Strategic planning and target-setting
- Initiative prioritization  
- Stakeholder communication
- Business case development
- NOT: Exact predictions or guarantees

---

## Success Criteria

**The model is successful if:**
1. Predictions within ±5% of actual results
2. Helps prioritize initiatives effectively
3. Passes board/stakeholder scrutiny
4. Drives better decisions
5. Improves over time with calibration

**Current status:** Ready for pilot validation

## Questions to Answer

**For client:**
1. Is 6.5% starting point acceptable, or should it be 10%?
2. Does changing assessment update savings (reactivity working)?
3. Do role and bucket breakdowns look realistic?
4. Ready for board presentation?

**For next AI session:**
1. What was the final calibration multiplier used?
2. Did we commit to git?
3. What feedback did client provide?
4. What's the next priority?

---

**Status:** Awaiting client validation of current calibration
